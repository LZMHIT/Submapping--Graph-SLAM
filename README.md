Final project:
- Switching from ap_hill_07b dataset to Intel dataset (https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/datasets/)
	- Comes in data formatted as nodes and edges
- Use GTSAM (MATLAB) to apply SAM to graph data -- back end
- Do feature extraction, data association, loop closure -- front end

TODO (all):
- Install/learn GTSAM
- Understand GraphSLAM
- Figure out how to apply submapping to this problem
